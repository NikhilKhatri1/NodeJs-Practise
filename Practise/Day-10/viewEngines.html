    In a Node.js application, a view engine allows you to dynamically generate and render HTML content
    on the server-side and send it to the client's browser.

<p>
    A view engine in JavaScript, especially in the context of Node.js/Express,
    helps in rendering dynamic HTML content by
    combining templates with data. Some of the most popular view engines include EJS, Pug, Handlebars, and Mustache.
    Using a view engine can improve code readability,
    reduce repetition, and allow for a more flexible and modular architecture.
