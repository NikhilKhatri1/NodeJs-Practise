    Creating and managing databases

    Creating and managing collections

    CRUD operations:

        Inserting documents (insertOne, insertMany)

        Querying documents (find, findOne)

        Updating documents (updateOne, updateMany, replaceOne)

        Deleting documents (deleteOne, deleteMany)

    Data types in MongoDB

    Importing and exporting data (mongoimport, mongoexport)

3. Querying Data

    Basic queries with find

    Query operators:

        Comparison operators ($eq, $ne, $gt, $lt, etc.)

        Logical operators ($and, $or, $not, $nor)

        Array operators ($in, $nin, $all, $elemMatch)

        Element operators ($exists, $type)

    Projection in queries

    Sorting and limiting results (sort, limit, skip)

    Aggregation pipeline basics ($match, $group, $sort, etc.)

4. Indexing and Performance Optimization

    What are indexes and why are they important?

    Types of indexes (single field, compound, multikey, text, geospatial, etc.)

    Creating and managing indexes

    Indexing strategies and best practices

    Using explain to analyze query performance

    Covered queries and index intersection

5. Aggregation Framework

    Introduction to the aggregation pipeline

    Stages in the aggregation pipeline:

        $match, $group, $sort, $project, $unwind, $lookup, etc.

    Using expressions and operators in aggregation

    Aggregation pipeline optimization

    Map-reduce (legacy) vs aggregation pipeline

6. Data Modeling in MongoDB

    Relational vs document data modeling

    Embedding vs referencing documents

    Schema design patterns:

        One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships

        Polymorphic schemas

        Bucket pattern, subset pattern, etc.

    Schema validation and constraints

7. Advanced MongoDB Features

    Transactions in MongoDB

    Replication and high availability:

        Replica sets and their configuration

        Failover and election process

    Sharding and horizontal scaling:

        Shard keys and chunk distribution

        Config servers and query routers

    Geospatial queries and indexes

    Full-text search with MongoDB

8. MongoDB Security

    Authentication and authorization

    Role-based access control (RBAC)

    Encryption at rest and in transit

    Network security and firewalls

    Auditing and logging

9. MongoDB Tools and Integrations

10. MongoDB Administration

    Backup and restore strategies (mongodump, mongorestore)

    Monitoring and profiling

    Performance tuning and optimization

    Upgrading MongoDB

    Managing storage engines (WiredTiger, in-memory, etc.)

11. Real-World Applications and Projects

    Building a REST API with MongoDB

    Building a full-stack application (MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

    Data analytics with MongoDB aggregation

    Migrating from SQL to MongoDB

    Case studies of MongoDB in production

12. Best Practices and Troubleshooting

    Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

    Debugging slow queries

    Schema design best practices

    Scaling strategies for large datasets
